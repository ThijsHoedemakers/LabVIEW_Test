### SETUP GIT REPOSITORY	
- right click the desired folder
- select 'git create repository here' 
- no worries about the message (it is indeed non-empty but that right)
- create a '.gitignore' file where you specify which files you do not want to push to the repository
- right click on the folder again
- this time, the option " Git Commit -> 'master' ... "  should appear. Click on that.
- If done correctly, the files/extensions from .gitignore do not appear here
- Select the files you want to have in the repository
- Add a descriptive message in the 'message'-box (not general but specific to what is done)

### SYNC WITH GITHUB
- Right click on the folder and go to ' Git sync' 
- Keep that open while you go to the github-repository and click 'Clone or download'  and copy the url
- Paste the link in the 'Remote URL:'  tab
- NOTE : if you get an error do the following first : 
	-you might have to do a 'pull'  first (right click on the folder -> TortoiseGit -> Pull )
- Now the repository should be locally on your computer

### SETUP DIFF WITH LABVIEW ON TORTOISEGIT
- Right click -> TortoiseGit -> Settings -> Diff Viewer -> Advanced
- Set extension to '.vi'  and External program to :  "C:\Program Files (x86)\National Instruments\Shared\LabVIEW Compare\LVCompare.exe" %mine %base -nobdcosm -nobdpos
	or an other location where LVCompare.exe is saved
- Do the same for 'ctl', 'ctt', 'vit'  
- Go to 'Merge Tool'  underneath 'Diff Viewer' 
- Do the same for 'vi','vit','ctt' and 'ctl'  with the following External program : "C:\Program Files (x86)\National Instruments\Shared\LabVIEW Merge\LVMerge.exe" %base %theirs %mine %merged

### Compare VI's, CTL's etc.
- Once something is changed, right click in the folder
- Select 'TortoiseGit -> Diff' and observe the differences made in the LVCompare.exe
