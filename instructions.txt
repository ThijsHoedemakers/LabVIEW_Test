### Download GIT & TorqoiseGit
- Follow the steps on the setup on : https://git-scm.com/download/win
- Same for : https://tortoisegit.org/download/
- Open PuTTYgen, found in the TortoiseGit folder
- Create a public/private keypair. Save them both in a place you can later find
- Open 'Pageant', also in TortoiseGit folder, and set the key just created

### SETUP GIT REPOSITORY	
- right click the desired folder
- select 'git create repository here' 
- no worries about the pop-up message (it is indeed non-empty but that right)
- create a '.gitignore' file (nothing in front, simply dot-gitignore), where you specify which files you do not want to push to the repository 
	(e.g. when creating datafiles for analysis, you might not want them to your repository)
	(usefull doc: https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/how-to-use-gitignore-file)
- right click inside the folder again
- this time, the option " Git Commit -> 'master' ... "  should appear. Click on that.
- If done correctly, the files/extensions .gitignore appear in 'not versioned files'
- Select the files you want to have in the repository
- Add a descriptive message in the 'message'-box (not general but specific to what is done)
- Press Commit
- Press close
- Right click -> TortoiseGit -> Push

### SYNC WITH GITHUB
- Right click on the folder, ->TortoiseGit -> Pull 
- Choose Arbitrary URL and copy the link from 'Clone or download' from your github repository
- Right click on the folder and go to ' Git sync' 
- Keep that open while you go to the github-repository and click 'Clone or download'  and copy the url
- Paste the link in the 'Remote URL:'  tab
- NOTE : if you get an error do the following first : 
	-you might have to do a 'pull'  first (right click on the folder -> TortoiseGit -> Pull )
- Now the repository should be locally on your computer

### SETUP DIFF WITH LABVIEW ON TORTOISEGIT
- Right click on folder -> TortoiseGit -> Settings -> Diff Viewer -> Advanced
- Set extension to '.vi'  and External program to :  "C:\Program Files (x86)\National Instruments\Shared\LabVIEW Compare\LVCompare.exe" %mine %base -nobdcosm -nobdpos
	or an other location where LVCompare.exe is saved
- Do the same for 'ctl', 'ctt', 'vit'  
- Go to 'Merge Tool'  underneath 'Diff Viewer' 
- Do the same for 'vi','vit','ctt' and 'ctl'  with the following External program : "C:\Program Files (x86)\National Instruments\Shared\LabVIEW Merge\LVMerge.exe" %base %theirs %mine %merged

### Compare VI's, CTL's etc.
- Once something is changed, right click in the folder
- Select 'TortoiseGit -> Diff' and observe the differences made with use of LVCompare.exe

### GET NEW FILES
- There are different ways to get your master branch up to date
- Once all the other branches are pushed to the origin, you can simply pull from that origin
- Sometimes you would want to merge with a branch, while leaving other branches alone
